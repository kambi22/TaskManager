- **MongoDB (Atlas) & Mongoose** (for database management)

## Features

- **Update Task**: Edit existing task details.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **View Tasks**: See all added tasks in a structured format.
- **Mark as Completed**: Mark tasks as done.
- **Light & Dark Mode**: Toggle between themes for a better user experience.
